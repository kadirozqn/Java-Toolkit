# Java Toolkit

---

Hello Java enthusiasts! üëã

This repository contains **illustrative and understandable code examples covering various topics in the Java programming language, from basic to advanced levels.** My goal is to guide you through your Java learning journey and help you better grasp concepts by providing practical applications for different subjects.

Whether you're just starting with Java or looking to refresh your knowledge on a specific topic, this "Java Toolkit" aims to offer valuable resources.

## üöÄ Project Goal

The primary objectives of this project are:

* **Education:** To teach fundamental Java concepts, syntax, and core principles through practical examples.
* **Reference:** To create a resource where you can quickly find code examples for a specific Java topic or feature.
* **Reinforcement:** To help solidify theoretical knowledge by observing and applying it in real code.
* **Community Contribution:** To assist other developers learning Java and foster knowledge sharing.

## üì¶ Content and Topics

The repository contains code examples organized into packages based on their topics. Here are the main topics currently covered (this list may expand over time):

* `abstractInterface` **(Abstraction and Interfaces):** Usage of abstract classes, abstract methods, and Java interfaces.
* `azKodCokIs` **(Less Code, More Work):** Likely covers practical, concise, and effective coding techniques or an introduction to design patterns frequently used in Java. (You can elaborate on this based on its actual content.)
* `azKodCokIsSorular` **(Less Code, More Work Questions):** Practical problems or solutions related to the `azKodCokIs` topic.
* `collections` **(Collections):** Java Collections Framework structures such as `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `HashSet`, `TreeSet`, `HashMap`, `TreeMap`, and their uses.
* `collections_projects` **(Collections Projects):** Mini-projects or more comprehensive examples developed using collections.
* `degiskenler` **(Variables):** Different data types in Java, variable declaration, and usage.
* `exceptions` **(Exceptions - Error Handling):** `try-catch-finally` blocks, throwing exceptions (`throw`), custom exceptions, and error handling principles.
* `generics` **(Generics):** Usage of generic classes, interfaces, and methods that provide type safety.
* `kontrolYapilari` **(Control Structures):** Conditional statements (`if-else`, `switch`) and loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`).
* `metotlarVeDiziler` **(Methods and Arrays):** Method definition, parameters, return types, and usage of single-dimensional/multi-dimensional arrays.
* `metotlarVeDizilerSorular` **(Methods and Arrays Questions):** Practical exercises and problem-solving related to methods and arrays.
* `oopGiris` **(OOP Introduction):** Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), classes, objects, fields (attributes), and methods.
* `oopSorular` **(OOP Questions):** Exercises and example problems related to Object-Oriented Programming principles.
* `operatorler` **(Operators):** Arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, and bitwise operators.
* `rasyonel_sayi_kutuphanesi` **(Rational Number Library):** An example of a custom class or library representing rational numbers and performing basic operations on them.
* `threads` **(Multithreading - Threads):** Fundamentals of creating and managing multithreading in Java with the `Thread` class and `Runnable` interface.

Each topic folder typically contains one or more `.java` files with explanatory comments supporting the code examples.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run
